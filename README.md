# DIABETES-PREDICTION

Diabetes is a hazardous and serious condition that is caused due to abnormality of glucose level in blood. Nowadays, diabetes prediction at early stage is beneficial for the healthcare of mankind, so that it can save many lives on this earth. It has become one of the major causes of human death therefore treatment at early stage of this disease is important. Imbalanced diet, irregular exercise, obesity, genetic inheritance, blood pressure etc, are some causes those results in diabetes.
The different machine learning algorithms and techniques such as Logistic Regression , Random Forest ,Support Vector Machine , Decision Tree and other machine learning models that are used by different researchers. This research will proceed the PIMA dataset which is fetched originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The comparison of the different machine learning models are further processed into boosting classifier algorithms like Ada-Boost, Gradient Boosting and Stacking Classifiers that results in the prediction of diabetes. 

Final Result and Algorithms -
KNN = 77%
SVM = 79%
MLP = 75%
RF  = 78%
NB  = 76%

Future Work : Try for Stacking Classifier Algorithms. ( Combining two or more algorithms to increase the efficiency of result )
